\section{Scope and Purpose}
This document is intended for analyzing \textit{TrackMe} software application and specifications through analysis of test cases extracted from requirements explained in documents presented.

\section{Project Analized}

To perform the acceptance on test cases we used all the documents provided by authors (i.e. RASD, DD and ITD). The latter has been primarily used for installation and setup instructions; first two instead have been used for extracting test cases in order to proceed with the analysis.

\section{Installation Setup}
\subsection{Server Installation}
Backend installation was straightforward. However, database installation wasn't.\\

We had to ask further instructions to setup the database and explicitly ask to get a database dump (it was asked to construct the database from scratch following the tables described in the document).\\

\subsection{Client Installation}

\section{Additional Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standards compliance, found on RASD2 at page 73, doesn't make any sense. Searching \textbf{D0-178C} standard on Google we found that is the primary document by which the certification authorities such as FAA, EASA and Transport Canada approve \textbf{all commercial software-based aerospace systems}. We asked the development team an explanation, and they confirmed that it was indeed that standard.
    Their system is described as a \textbf{Level D risk level} which, according to online resources, corresponds to: \textit{Failure slightly reduces the safety margin or slightly increases crew workload. Examples might include causing passenger inconvenience or a routine flight plan change.}
    \item The alloy model was poorly done. This is easily seen at page 85 of RASD2: multiple users have the same FC, that is clearly wrong.
    \item IOS only was a bad choice for a prototype. That is because, if you don't have a macOS, you \textbf{can't test} the whole frontend application.
\end{itemize}
