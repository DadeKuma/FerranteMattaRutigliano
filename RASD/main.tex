\section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Purpose}
    This Requirement Analysis and Specification Document is aimed at modeling and describing the system itself, its requirements, its constraints, its components and how it interacts with the world and the users. Moreover, this specifications also addresses some relevant QoS characteristics that the system should guarantee. 
        
    This document is directed and highly recommended to software designers and developers interested in the design and deployment of the proposed system.
    
    \subsection{Scope and Audience}
        \subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
        \textit{TrackMe} is a company that wants to develop an ease of use health monitoring application which offers different services for both young and old people who needs to keep track of their personal data in order to to keep their health safe.
        
        The system should provide an efficient data acquisition facility which gives the possibility to verified \textit{third-party} signed onto the service to request health status information about subscribed customers. The application may also allow \textit{individual} users to connect \textit{external devices} such as smart-watches or similar, to perform a more detailed data acquisition and monitoring.
        
        In addition, the \textit{third-party} may also provide a personalized and non intrusive SOS service for elderly people who requested it.
    
        Moreover, through the \textit{Track4Run} service, \textit{TrackMe} wants to provide to users signed in the application to create a new run: a competition in which other individuals can either participate as \textit{athletes} or watch as \textit{spectators}. Additionally, this feature may exploits other service functionality for keeping track of athletes progresses and for helping them to prevent major accident happen during the run.
        
        \subsubsection{World, Machine and Phenomena}
        
        This section is intended to provide a full description of the proposed system by meaning of \textit{Domains} and \textit{Phenomena} \cite{zave1997four}.
    
        The \textit{Machine Domain} is the set of phenomena that the machine can control: data structures, algorithms, devices and inputs it can get from the world.
        
        In contrast, the \textit{World Domain} is the real-life context in which the \textit{Machine} will be introduced. This is the part of the real-world in which the \textit{Machine} actions will be observed.
        
        The World and the Machine are connected too, because the latter should interact with the first one: this interaction is done through \textit{Shared Domain}, whose phenomena are observable both by the Machine and by the World. Shared Phenomena include events in the real world that the Machine can directly sense and actions in the real world that the Machine can directly cause.

    \subsection{Document Overview}
        This initial part of the document is intended to provide both an overview of the problem and an idea of the proposed solution.
        
        Following section is aimed at giving a more detailed description of the proposed system, by meaning of the application point of view. Additionally, it addresses functionality, user characteristics, dependencies and constraints.
        
        Third chapter shows a detailed analysis of \textit{TrackMe} in terms both functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Furthermore, takes into account requirements mapping on use cases and their detailed description through well known standards for specification documents such as \textit{UML} for Use Case, Sequence and Activity Diagrams \cite{rumbaugh2004unified}.
        
        Endmost section illustrates \textit{Alloy} for formal analysis \cite{jackson2006software} describing models including purpose, proof and explanation. In addition, describes worlds obtained by running them.
        
        Further, there is a list of tables and a list of figures at the beginning of the document representing respectively use cases and diagrams in order to help the reader to understand them and navigate the specification.

\section{Overall Description}
    \subsection{Product Perspective}
    
    The system is not part of any already existing software and can be completely developed from scratch. It should interface with a database server (even local), shall be able to interact with several GPS systems from several manufacturers widely used in mobile devices and may be able to do the same with external devices such as smart-watches of different kind. Furthermore, it should be capable of cooperating with an \textit{"ambulance dispatcher"} system in order to make reservations of ambulances in case of accident.
    
    The proposed solution is \textit{TrackMe}, a new health monitoring application which consists of a back-end server that manages users' registration, login and data and allows to keep everything synchronized between the two front-end applications:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a web-based application to supply to the end user an ease of use interface web interface for \textit{TrackMe};
            \item a mobile application that allows the user to easily access the system from the smartphone.
        \end{itemize}
    
    The system should be able to query the database for storing and retrieving both users' credentials and personal data, besides of keeping everything synchronized between all the application instances.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Product Functions}
    \textit{TrackMe} will provide three main services: \textit{Data4Help}, \textit{Automated-SOS} and \textit{Track4Run}.
    
    \paragraph{Data4Help :}
    the application will provide both \textit{"Sign-on"} and \textit{"Sign-in"} pages and will be able to register new users and to check credentials used to login.
    
    To register himself an user must provide an username and a password as well as his personal information. To be logged in, the user should send through the login form his credentials which the system will use to authenticate him.
    
    \textit{TrackMe} may yield an interface that allows individual users to connect external devices and if so, of course a method for acquiring data from it.
    
    The application should also provide to third-parties two possible data request options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item individual data request: sent directly to the individual if they know an  individual by his/her social security number or fiscal code in Italy;
        \item group data request: access  to  anonymous  data  of  groups  of  individuals, if \textit{TrackMe}  that  approves  them  if  it  is  able  to  properly  anonymize  the  requested  data.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{Automated-SOS:} the system implements \textit{Data4Help} services to manage individual's personal data and provide them to third-parties who requested for. In addition, there should be an interface both for third-party and individual users registered to \textit{Data4Help} that wants to enable an \textit{Automated-SOS} service. This feature should be able to use users' data to monitor their health status and, when such parameters are below certain thresholds, sends the location of the customer to an ambulance. Thus, the application should be able to interact with the GPS system of the customers' devices.
    
    \textit{Automated-SOS} is built on top of \textit{Data4Help} and provides individuals the capability of subscribing to third-parties who has enabled the service.
    
    \paragraph{Track4Run: } the software should provide to users that wants to use \textit{Track4Run} all the facilities they need such as a page for the creation of a new run with all the information (track, date and time) and two different pages to allow both spectators and athletes either watch or enroll/unroll to an existing run.
    
    \textit{Track4Run} is also built on top of \textit{Data4Help} and allows third parties to create new runs where athletes can participate. Athletes' position can be tracked and it will be sent to all spectators that are watching the run on a map.
    
    \subsection{User Characteristics}
        \subsubsection{Data4Help}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Guest:} a customer that is visiting \textit{TrackMe}. He can only login or register to the system.
            \item \textbf{User:} a \textit{Guest} successfully registered to \textit{TrackMe} and logged in to the system. He can be either an \textit{Individual} or a \textit{Third Party.}
            \item \textbf{Individual:} an \textit{User} that agreed that \textit{TrackMe} can collect his personal data. He is identified by a SSN/FC. Data acquisition can happen through smart watches or similar devices.
            \item \textbf{Third Party:} an \textit{User} that can ask an \textit{Individual} to gain access to their personal data. He is identified by a VAT number. He can also request access to data that belongs to a group of \textit{Individuals}, but the request shall be accepted only if \textit{TrackMe} can guarantee anonymity to the requested data. During a request he can also subscribe to new data that will be received as soon as is it is produced.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Automated-SOS Extension}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Individual:} he can access to a list of Third Parties that enabled the Automated-SOS service. He can also select a Third Party from the list and subscribe to it.
            \item \textbf{Third Party:} it has the ability to enable the Automated-SOS service so that any Individual can subscribe to it.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \subsubsection{Track4Run Extension}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Organizer:} both an \textit{Individual} and a \textit{Third Party} that created at least one run. He can create, start or delete a run.
            \item \textbf{Athlete:} an \textit{Individual} that enrolled a created run. His position will be sent to all Spectators that joined that run.
            \item \textbf{Spectator:} an \textit{Individual} that joined a started run. He can see the position of all Athletes that are competing in the run until the run is finished.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
    \comment{<Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>}
    
    \begin{description}
        \item[C-01] If an individual's health parameters are below ....... an ambulance must be called in less than 5 seconds.
    \end{description}
    
    \subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
    \comment{<List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).>}

        \end{figure}
        \newpage
        \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
        The GPS system of the smartphone or the one of the external device (if connected) is needed in order to track customer's position.
        
        Furthermore, a separate system to notify the ambulances in case of accident shall be integrated within already existing ambulances' on-board technologies. This system is, of course, connected with and managed by \textit{TrackMe}.
        
        \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

        \subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
        The application shall communicate with the back-end server over HTTPS and may enable O-Auth2 authentication protocol for clients. In order to connect and interact with external devices the mobile application shall also support BT and/or NFC.
        
        The back-end services connect to the DBMS on the default port.

    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
        
        \subsubsection{Reliability}
        The system must work without failure in most of the cases. The possibility of a breakdown depends on the stability of the Internet connection and on the availability of the external services such as the Ambulance Dispatcher. In this case the users wont be able to access the system and, in case of an incident, any ambulance will receive a call.
        \subsubsection{Availability}
        To guarantee the maximum profit by the service, in particular the one provide by Automated-SOS, the system must be available 24 hours per day and 7 day per week.
        %complete Availability
        \subsubsection{Security}
        The user allows the system to collect their health data. Furthermore, the position of the user is also present in the system, to provide services such as Automated SOS an Track4Run. If there is a leak of information the privacy of the user is compromised. For this reason several security features shall be granted:
       
        \begin{itemize}
        \item         The users passwords are stored in the database hashed with SHA256\item       The  connection between the clients and servers are encrypted and sent over SSL to guarantee integrity of data. 
        \end{itemize}
        
        \subsubsection{Maintainability}

        The system is backed up 2 times a  week. in order to guarantee the database integrity and consistency. To avoid loss of data  the database is saved in 3 copy and the power supply is provided by a particular system that keeps online at least one database. Moreover an UPS is present. 
        
        \subsubsection{Portability}

        The system can work both on smart phone and desktop environment. Any personal computer with Java installed can execute TrackMe. Diffent version of of Android and iOS can run this application.
