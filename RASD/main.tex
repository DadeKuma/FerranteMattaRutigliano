\section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Purpose}
    This Requirement Analysis and Specification Document addresses the description in terms of functional and non-functional requirements of \textit{TrackMe}, a new health monitoring application.
    
    This document is aimed at giving an explanation both of the problem and of the proposed software-based solution by pointing out different features of the application. Moreover, this specifications also addresses some relevant QoS characteristics that the system should guarantee.
    
    Thus, the analysis is primarily focused on requirements elicitation and use cases description through well known standards for specification documents:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\textit{1)}] \textit{UML} for Use Case, Sequence and Activity Diagrams \cite{rumbaugh2004unified};
            \item[\textit{2)}] \textit{Alloy} for formal analysis \cite{jackson2006software}.
        \end{itemize}
        
    This document is mostly directed and likely necessary to software designers and developers interested in the deployment of the proposed system.
    
    \subsection{Scope and Audience}
        \subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
        
        \subsubsection{Description of the proposed system}
        \textit{TrackMe} is an ease of use health monitoring application which offers different services for both young and old people who needs to keep track of their personal data in order to to keep their health safe.
        
        This proposed system provides a very efficient data acquisition service named \textit{Data4Help}. This facility gives the possibility to verified \textit{third-party} registered onto the service to request health status information about subscribed customers. The application may also allow \textit{individual} users to connect \textit{external devices} such as smart-watches or similar, to perform a more detailed data acquisition and monitoring.
        
        In addition, the application provides also a fully automated SOS service for elderly people: \textit{Automated-SOS} uses \textit{Data4Help} features to monitor the health status and, when such parameters are below certain thresholds, sends the location of the customer to an ambulance.
    
        Moreover, through the \textit{Track4Run} service, \textit{TrackMe} allows customers to create a new run, a competition in which other users can either participate as \textit{athletes} or watch as \textit{spectators}. Additionally, this service may exploits other service functionality for keeping track of athletes progresses and for helping them to prevent major accident happen during the run. 
        \subsubsection{Goals}
        
        \begin{description}
            \item[G.01] Goal
        \end{description}
    
    \subsection{Document Overview}
        This part of the document is intended to provide both an overview of the problem and an idea of the proposed solution.
        
        Next section is aimed at giving a more detailed description of the proposed system, by meaning of the application point of view. Additionally, addresses users characteristic, dependencies and constraint.
        
        Third chapter shows a detailed analysis of \textit{TrackMe} in terms both functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Furthermore, takes into account definition of all use cases, their description through UML diagrams and their mapping on requirements.
        
        Fourth section illustrates \textit{Alloy} models including purpose, proof and explanation. In addition, describes worlds obtained by running them.
        
        Last part is about effort spent in writing this document in terms of hours of work.
        
        There is also a list of tables and a list of figures representing respectively use cases and diagrams in order to help the reader to understand them and navigate the specification.

        \subsubsection{Registration}
        \textit{TrackMe} must provide a registration interface for both \textit{individual} and \textit{third-party} users.
        
        An \textit{individual} must provide his/her SSN (Social Security Number) or FC (Fiscal Code) during the registration phase in order to be uniquely identified by \textit{TrackMe} application. In this way, the user is also accepting terms of service and allows \textit{TrackMe} to acquire his/her personal data.
