\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
    The Purpose of this Design Document is to provide the precise implementation details required to satisfy the requirements specified in the RASD \cite{rasd}.
    It is assumed that the reader has read the RASD before this document.
    
    The purpose of this paper is also to point out the main components, their interfaces and their behaviours, show the high level architecture and its interaction with architectural components and to identify style and design patterns that shall be used in deployment of the application. This Document will provide detailed explanation of each functionality through components and sequence diagrams also used to explain to programmers the overall structure of the system in a precise and implementation-oriented way.
    
    Furthermore this document provides also an \textit{Implementation \& Test} plan in order to give to the developer a precise idea of the deployment process.
 
\subsection{Scope}
    The scope of this application is to provide health monitoring services for both young and old people who needs to keep track of their personal data in order to to keep their health safe.
    
    \textit{TrackMe} allows Third-Party to access Individual's health data exploiting the functionality of \textit{Data4help} service: Third-Parties can make individual requests that the Individuals can accept or reject, or group requests handled directly by TrackMe that approves them if it is able to properly anonymize the requested data. For sake of simplicity, we already assumed that TrackMe will accept any request for which the number of individuals whose data satisfy the request is higher than 1000. The application may also allow individual users to connect external devices such as smart-watches, specific pathology's monitoring devices or other types of external devices able to monitor health parameters with BT or NFC connection.

    In addition, the system permits to enable the \textit{Automated-SOS} service that guarantees that the GPS position of the user who has enabled \textit{Automated SOS}, can be send to the nearest ambulance available, when user's health parameters overcome some critical thresholds. This procedure takes place thanks to an ambulance dispatcher connected to the Third-Party which has enabled automated sos service and has been selected by that individual to provide this service.
   
    Moreover, through  the \textit{Track4Run} service, \textit{TrackMe} allows \textit{Organizers}  to  \textit{create}  a  new  run: a  competition  in  which other individuals can either participate as \textit{athletes} or watch as \textit{spectators}.  Additionally, this feature guarantees other services for keeping track of athletes progresses during the run, providing an interactive map of the run, with runners position on it.

\subsection{Selected Architectural Styles and Patterns}
    \subsubsection{Architecture}
    In order to implement such architecture, based on RESTful API, the following architectural style and design pattern should be taken into account:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Three Tier Architecture:] as showed previously in this document, the layered architecture pattern allows to separate the presentation from the business logic and to realize a thin client with only the user interfaces and input forms and a more complex server that handles all the software services.
        The overall architecture is structured as a three tier architecture: the \textit{Client Layer}, the \textit{Server Layer} and the \textit{Database Layer}.
        
        \item[Layered Server:] The main component of the system is the Server Layer, that it's also deployed on three different layers: the \textbf{Application Layer}, the \textbf{Service Layer} and the \textbf{Persistence Layer}.
        These layers are respectively mapped on the three main components of the software application: \newline controllers, services and repositories.
        \begin{figure}[!htpb]
            	\centering
            	\includegraphics[width=0.84\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{DD/images/ServerLayer.png}
            	\caption{Server Layer diagram}
        \end{figure}
        \newline
        The \textbf{Application Layer} communicates directly with client browser and mobile application, while the \textbf{Service Layer} manages all the application logic: the latter is invoked by the Application Layer. \\
        Lastly the \textbf{Persistence Layer}: here the application has all the database management logic and is responsible of the communication with the DBMS. This layer is invoked by the Logic Layer.\\
        This was done to add \textbf{separation of concerns}: each layer is specialized in a specific activity.
        
        \newpage
        \item[Model View Presenter (MVP):] in this pattern there are three entities: the \textit{Model} which essentially maintains all the data, the \textit{View} that is responsible of showing the model's data and routes user commands to the presenter, and finally the \textit{Presenter} that is responsible of handling the data access from \textit{Model} and to format it to display in the view.
        This architecture is used in the \textit{Client Layer}.
        \begin{figure}[!hb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=50mm, keepaspectratio]{DD/images/mvp.png}
            \caption{MVP Architecture}
            \label{fig:mvp}
        \end{figure}
    \end{description}
    \subsubsection{Design Patterns}
    \begin{description}
    \item[Publisher-Subscriber:] this is the most important pattern that is used in the application. It is used for almost anything from handling \textit{Data4Help} requests to send athlete positions to spectators through \textit{Track4Run}.
    \begin{figure}[!hb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{DD/images/pubsub.png}
        \caption{Pub/Sub Pattern}
        \label{fig:pubsub}
    \end{figure}
    
    This is necessary for performance reasons: \textit{TrackMe} is a data-intensive real-time system, so \textit{polling} is not a viable strategy in this case.
    \textit{WebSockets} are clearly the best solution and this is why this pattern shall be used.\\
    Suppose a scenario where a Third Party wants to subscribe to the data of an Individual named Pippo. When Pippo registers to the application, \textit{TrackMe} creates a \textit{topic} associated with him. The Third Party becomes a subscriber of that topic: every time Pippo (Publisher) upload his data, the associated topic is updated and all Third Parties subscribed to him (Subscriber) are notified.
    \end{description}

\subsection{Other Design Decisions}
\subsubsection{Client Localization}
The management of the external device is a client only operation that will allow the application to get Individual's personal health data from the smart device and send them to the server in a lightweight format (e.g. JSON).\\ 

The client map of the run is \textit{local} too: the run organizer will be able (through Google Maps API) to draw a path on an interactive map and send it to the server which will be able to decode the run path and store it as a string; also spectators will be able to use a map to see athletes positions and again, the map will be local too. The Server will provide only athlete positions with the associated track.

\subsubsection{Client Native Application}
In order to allow the user to exploit all the functions of \textit{TrackMe}, the mobile app should be developed for native \textit{Android}/\textit{iOS}. This is necessary for performance reasons.\textit{TrackMe} is a real-time system that relies heavily on data transfer where performance must be maximized; an \textbf{hybrid application} was considered a bad choice for the following reasons:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slower than native application;
    \item Have to work with a wrapper dependent on a third party platform.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Client Web Application}
In addition, a web application may be further developed in order to allow customers to use \textit{Data4Help} features also from their Personal Computers; \textit{Automated-Sos} and \textit{Track4Run} services will instead be available only on mobile devices.

\subsubsection{Programming Languages and Frameworks}
In this design document we assumed the developer is using Java as program-\newline ming language and in particular is deploying the application server through Spring Framework. The rationale for this choice is that this framework fits very well the architectural style of the proposed software solution, has proprietary implementation of the Model View Controller design patter and of several APIs and is very suitable for both provisioning and consuming RESTful services. \\

The choice of using Java and Spring is not a full restriction on the deployment process. In a decision to use a different programming language or to not use Spring Framework would occur, due to the proprietary implementation of several classes, such as the persistence API or the Spring MVC ones, some adaptions to the class diagram may be needed.

\newpage
\section{User Interface Design}
As specified in RASD there are two different user interfaces, one for mobile application and one for web browsers. In this specification we assume the web version of the application will be the same as the mobile application with reduced functions.

\subsection{Mockups}
The guest who access to the main page can sign-up to the application providing his credentials. Once clicked on the \textit{Sign On} button the guest can decide whether registers as an Individual or as a Third-Party, swiping left and right to choose the wright option. Once registered, on the initial page, an user can sign-in in the application inserting Username and Password in the relative boxes and clicking on the \textit{Sign In} button. 

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/Login_Registration.png}
    	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{DD/images/mockups/IndividualRegistration.png}
    	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/ThirdPartyRegistration.png}
        \end{figure}

Once inside the application, the user is redirected to the home page, where he can see his account data. He can press the top-left menu and navigate from there. Here the user can access to services provided by \textit{Data4help} and can enable \textit{Automated-SOS} service too. Individual can also access to \textit{Track4Run} and \textit{External Devices} section. The Individuals can handle incoming request by accepting or rejecting them on the Manage Request page. 

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/IndividualProfile.png}
    	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/IndividualProfileOpen.png}
    	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/ManageRequests.png}
\end{figure}

Third-parties can choose either individual or group request and can enable the option to subscribe to new data.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/ThirdPartyProfile.png}
    \includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/ThirdPartyProfileOpen.png}
\end{figure}

The Third- Party, form the Data4Help page, can also reach the view data section: here she can see and plot the data of sent requests. Furthermore, swiping left and right, it can move between individual and group data.
\begin{figure}[!htpb]		
     	\centering		
     	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/Requests.png}		
     	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/GroupRequest.png}		
     	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/ViewData.png}		
     	\includegraphics[height=50mm]{images/mockups/ViewData2.png}

Once in the \textit{Truck4Run} section, the individual can create, watch, enroll, unroll, start or delete a run.  In the create run page, he can set all the characteristic of the run. Furthermore, he can access to an interactive map to set up the path of the run. In the section watch run there's instead a map with all the position of athletes.

\subsection{User Experience}
    In this specification we include only mobile users' experience because for web application clients the experience will be the same except for the fact that all \textit{Automated-Sos} and most of \textit{Track4Run} function will be unavailable for web browsers.

\section{Implementation, Integration \& Test Plan}
With respect to specific application services, the implementation plan to be followed should be to develop first \textit{Data4Help} functions and then \textit{Automated-Sos} and \textit{Track4Run} facilities, which are built on top of \textit{Data4Help} service.\\

\textit{Authentication} subsystem instead can be implemented independently on the order on which other components are; an implementation strategy for this module is to deploy it in parallel with Data4Help subsystem.

\subsection{Test Strategy}
Despite this document follows a \textit{Top-Down} style starting from an high level point of view to a detailed components and operations description, we advise an \textit{I\&T} plan following the \textit{Bottom-Up} approach, in which modules at lowest layer will be tested first and upper layers will follow then.\\

The unit testing is focused on testing all the software components' features, then the test will proceed to the integration phase: integration of two components will start only after components executing that operations pass the unit test to ensure that the components themselves work fine and that any failure is related to the integration itself.\\

Components to be tested are listed below; integration test will flow from right to left:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Integration between Authenticator Controller and Service:
    \begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/test/authenticator_integration.png}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item Integration between components of \textit{Data4Help} Subsystem:
    \begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/test/data4help_integration.png}
    \end{figure}
    \newpage
    \begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/test/data4help_subscription_integration.png}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item Integration between components of \textit{AutomatedSos} Subsystem:
    \begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/test/automated_sos_integration.png}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item Integration between components of \textit{Track4Run} Subsystem:
    \begin{figure}[!htpb]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/test/track4run_integration.png}
    \end{figure}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Entry Criteria}
\subsubsection{Unit Test}
The \textit{Unit Test} phase will start only after:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item the proposed system architecture has been designed and reviewed;
    \item testable code for units to be tested is available;
    \item the test environment has been properly configured and is ready to run.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration Test}
The \textit{Integration Test} phase will start only when:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit Test phase is completed;
    \item each component has gone through and passed the unit test phase before the integration phase;
    \item all priority bugs found in the unit test phase are fixed and marked as solved;
    \item the test environment has been properly configured and is ready to run.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exit Criteria}
\subsubsection{Unit Test}
The \textit{Unit Test} phase will end only after:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item all unit tests are successfully executed;
    \item priority bugs are fixed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration Test}
The \textit{Integration Test} phase will end only after:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item integration system has passed all functional requirements;
    \item integration system has passed all performance requirements;
    \item all high severity or top priority bug has been fixed;
    \item high risk identified area has been taken up and tested. \newline
\end{itemize}

If \textit{I\&T} integration exit criteria are satisfied, the test phase can move on to the System Testing in which Load, Performance and Stress tests may be useful to highlight some Quality of Service leaking of the system.
