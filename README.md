# Software Engineering II Project (A.Y. 2018/2019)
This repository is owned by Davide Rutigliano, Claudio Ferrante and Davide Matta and contains all the documents needed to the developer of the proposed system.

## Documents
* First we propose a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document in order to describe and define both the problem and the model and also to point out requirements, dependencies and constraints of the proposed solution.

* Second folder is related to the Design Document in which we will describe all the design specifications and constraints such as architectural details, languages needed to implement the software previously analyzed and an integration and test plan.

* Then we moved on the *implementation & test* part in which we used these two documents and UML diagrams to build our software application documented below.

### Preview via Overleaf
In this readme we provided to readers also a [read-only link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cvwthghwqznk) to our overleaf project in order to have a pre-compiled version preview of all the documents we propose. In order to have the pdf of the desired document the reader should navigate to the folder, open the main file and recompile the document (e.g. to compile the RASD, the reader should go on "RASD/main.tex" and click "Recompile").

### Delivery
In the folders named after the documents we included our code, in Delivery Folder instead there are pdf version of latex documents which in order to be recognized will be named after the code folder too. For example "Requirement Analysis Document" is in RASD folder and the delivered file is called "RASD.pdf".

## Tools
### Latex
In order to write such documents adopted Latex editor, so we used
ShareLatex via Overleaf. This choice allowed us to work to the document quickly and from remote and also to link the Latex project with this github repository.

### UML
We used a professional UML diagrams software [magicDraw](https://www.magicdraw.com/main.php?ts=download_demo&cmd_go_to_login=1&menu=download_demo&back_cmd=cmd_show).
