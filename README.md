# Software Engineering II Project (A.Y. 2018/2019)

# Overview
This repository is owned by Davide Rutigliano, Claudio Ferrante and Davide Matta and contains all the documents needed to
the developer of the proposed system.

In order to write such documents we decided to use Latex editor, so we used
ShareLatex via Overleaf. This choice allowed us also to link Latex project with this github repository.

# Documents Preview via Overleaf
In this readme we also provided to the readers read-only links to our overleaf project in order to provide have a pdf version
preview of all the documents.
